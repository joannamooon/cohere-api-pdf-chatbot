Multilingual Chatbot built with Cohere's API, streamlit, and langchain. 

Cohere's multilingual model converts text into a semantic vector space, clustering texts with similar meanings close together. 

The chatbot answers questions based on uploaded text files/PDFs. Used the Cohere API for multilingual embeddings and LangChain for NLP tasks.
